# Java RPG Game

## Project Overview

This is a simple Role-Playing Game (RPG) developed in Java, designed to demonstrate core Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction. The game features a player character, enemies, items, and a basic combat system, all structured using OOP principles.

## Features

- **Player and Enemy Classes**: Utilize inheritance and polymorphism to define different character types with unique abilities.
- **Inventory System**: Implements encapsulation to manage player items securely.
- **Game Loop**: A simple loop to handle player input, game state updates, and rendering.
